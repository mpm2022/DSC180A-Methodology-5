# Quarter 2 Project Proposal questions
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
In causal discovery, I found the various algorithms interesting, specifically PC with fast KCI as we have learned to implement it from causal-learn for our project. In causal inference, the Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) method for estimating treatment effects. I was previously unfamiliar with this approach.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
We are thinking in keep moving forward with our current research, but we have considered other alternatives to twist our current dataset for a different research problem like prediction with causal representation learning.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Narrowing the scope to focus on a subset of genera from our microbial gut taxa, instead of analyzing all data at the genus level.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
We were thinking about representation learning for microbial interaction prediction, as well as considering longitudinal datasets to perform other causality strategies such as Granger to understand the changes over time.
